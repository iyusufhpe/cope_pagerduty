# How to use pdpyras to get incidents

## Environment setup
- Install virtualenv
- Install dependencies by using 
    ```python
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
- Create a .env file with your token. Otherwise the code will not function.
    - Sample .env
        ```python
            API_TOKEN=[[your token here]]
        ```


- Check if you are able to use pdpyras with your token by running get_started.ipynb
